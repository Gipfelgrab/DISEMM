Diffraction Assisted Mechanical Modeling

The software DISEMM is designed to analyse diffraction data from in situ loading
experiments for the determination of single-crystal elastic constants and an
elasto-plastic self-consistent modelling (EPSC) of lattice strains.

0.8.1 <br> 10.05.2021

-Fixed a Bug where the application crashes if no pattern data is added.<br>
-Exported the plot settings into an extra window, shifted the Tensile Experiment Stuff and increased the space for the slip families.<br>
-Fixed Path issue during Saving for the new Format. Now Files are actually saved where they should be saved.<br>
-Simplified plotting and fixed one issue during plotting selection in the EPSC Tab.<br>
-Fixed Index driving issue in the EPSC Tab. It now works fine.<br>
-Improved the performance of the hexagonal vektor normal calculation.<br>
-Changed EPSC Saving Intervall to 30 to further accelarate the loading until the ASP.NET Bug is fixed.<br>
-Fixed resolution Problems at the Main Window.<br>
-Application Icon Added.<br>
-Fixed Wavelength for V2A example data to the right value.<br>
-Changed the Ti Peak Data to V2A ready<br>
